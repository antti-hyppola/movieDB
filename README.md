# Movie DB
A movie database site built using TypeScript, React, Redux, Grommet and TMdb API.

I wanted to build another project using Redux and TypeScript and I've always loved movies so this was a pretty obvious choice for me.

I also enjoyed using a public API, as that is something I haven't really done in my projects so far. 

# How to use the site
Simply click on the movie posters or titles to see a more detailed movie page. 

You can also search for movies by title, but make sure you spell the title correctly (for example, e.t, not et).

Watch trailer button on the trailer carousel opens a new tab for YouTube trailer of the movie in question.

# What I learned, what I struggled with
I had a lot of fun with this project. I really enjoyed working with an external API and figuring out how to make requests the best way.

TypeScript still remains a challenge for me as I am trying to come to grips with different types. There are still many variables with 'any' type but I each line I write I feel more comfortable in working with TS.

I'm also getting a better handle on Redux, which is great. I still have ways to go in configuring the store, but I feel much more comfortable in using the state and dispatching actions in my components.

All in all, this was one of my favorite projects to build as it had a lot of things I had to figure out myself while I was going along.
